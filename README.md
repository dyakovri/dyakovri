## Projects and links to Git repos
### MSU Physics Faculty Student Union
    
https://github.com/profcomff

I had founded this organisation with my old student projects. Then it was grown into [Viribus Unitis](https://t.me/ViribusUnitisGroup) student club and I participated in most new projects as **PM**. Мы использовали современные популярные технологии в разработке, такие как **Python3** with **FastAPI**, **JavaScript** or **TypeScript** with **Vue3**, **GitHub Actions**.


### Mathematical modeling of simple physical processes (or just physics faculty final projects)

https://git.dyakov.space/physics-final-projects

Together with his brothers, they developed applications for mathematical modeling of processes. Such problems were assigned to students as final tasks in a programming course. Back then we used mainly **C++**, but also I had projects on **C#**, **Python3**, **Pascal** or **Delphi**, **PHP**.


### HSE software engineer hometasks
